Q5- Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for
on infected systems?

A5- If we extracted strings from this file we will find some of important strings.
![](/pics/Host_based_indicator.png) <br>
We will find this path which contain kernel32.dll, but if we look at this name well we will figure out **l** in this file is in fact **1**, so we can conclude that this file is not original dll, so we may get a host base indicator for this file.<br>
